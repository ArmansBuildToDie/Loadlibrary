This API is obfuscated to the public, however, it can still be used.

What's the purpose of this GUI? 
This GUI is a template login GUI that allows lazy developers to create and integrate their scripts/guis into encrypted, generated, and customized login page which can only access the GUI with a generated key. This saves a lot of time and resources for developers who want to integrate their projects into a safe-key.

If there ANY additional questions (that aren't stupid), you may ask me @Arman#9312
