This API is obfuscated to the public, however, it can still be used.

What's the purpose of this GUI? 
This GUI is a template login GUI that allows lazy developers to create and integrate their scripts/guis into encrypted, generated, and customized login page which can only access the GUI with a generated key. This saves a lot of time and resources for developers who want to integrate their projects into a safe-key.

If you are using a free exploit, or early development paid exploit, upon executing the script please press F9 or type "/console" in chat to make sure you don't find any errors. This is simply because some exploits supports functions that others may not (such as getgenv).

If there ANY additional questions (that aren't stupid), you may ask me @Arman#9312
